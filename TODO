* TODO Only charge $75 to begin with, then auto-discount upon auto-pay payment
  There's no way to force auto-pay on a person, so we'll have to wait
  until they have made their first payment to give them their
  discount. It can be applied in a webhook upon payment as well as via
  a redirect back to this app that checks the invoice and applies the
  discount if it's not already done (maybe one or the other only,
  since we don't want to double-discount).

** TODO Write authorize.net auto-refunder
   Because we can't add discounts via FreshBooks, we'll have to do it
   via Authorize.net instead. We should be able to take the the ref
   number in the invoice/payment and fetch the payment from Auth.net,
   then give a partial discount? At that point, we can edit the FB
   payment, then the FB invoice.
