* TODO Only charge $75 to begin with, then auto-discount upon auto-pay payment
  There's no way to force auto-pay on a person, so we'll have to wait
  until they have made their first payment to give them their
  discount. It can be applied in a webhook upon payment as well as via
  a redirect back to this app that checks the invoice and applies the
  discount if it's not already done (maybe one or the other only,
  since we don't want to double-discount).
